        <p class = "intro-text">Between January and June of 2025, 10 movies dominated Netflix's eyeballs:</p>
        <div id="top-10-figure"></div>
        <p class = "intro-text">These movies, with a combined 897,100,000 (897 million!) views, 
            were between just shy of one and a half hours (80 minutes) and just over two hours (130 minutes) long.
            While there are movies on Netflix ranging from 9 minutes long to 224 minutes long, a majority of Netflix films
            also fall in the range we find the top 10 most popular for this time period in.</p>
