// Tree Ring Chart

    // create dummy data (or look for wine harvest data by tonnage)

    // generate circles with radius = data + previous data points
        // generate largest circle last and generate smaller circles on top with alternating colors



// Box calendar?

    //  create a grid of squares (12 * 31)
        // for months with less than 31 days, leave squares blank or gray?
            // which would be accomplished by data with null values? 
    // fill in each square based on data (color)
    // add month and day labels
