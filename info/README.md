# Exercise 4: Netflix Geographic (or, NetGeo)

My previous Netflix visualizations involved graphing total Views against runtime to see genre level distributions of movie length. Was there a most popular runtime, and if so how long was it?

Adding a geographical element to this data changes the question from "what is the most popular runtime" to "which countries produce the longest movies?" Mean Movie Length in minutes is mapped to each country wth the colorscale from light orange to deep red. As some countries have many more movies than others on Netflix, Mean Movie Length may be skewed in some cases. 

Filtering by genre reveals genre-specific trends (and which countries are over-represented in specific genres). I tried to include mean Views for movies from each country, but mapping layers have few axes on which to map data. Below is an attempt.
